To check if another VM is up and running from one working VM, you can use several network diagnostic commands such as `ping`, `telnet`, `nslookup`, and others. Below is an explanation of these commands, why we use them, examples, and the details they provide:

---

### **1. `ping`**
#### **Why use it?**
`ping` checks the basic connectivity between two systems by sending ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests. It’s a quick way to verify if the destination VM is reachable over the network.

#### **Example:**
```bash
ping <destination-ip-or-hostname>
```
#### **Details provided:**
- **Success:** Indicates that the destination VM is reachable.
- **Response time:** Time taken for packets to travel to the destination and back.
- **Packet loss:** Shows if any packets were lost during transmission, which could indicate network issues.

#### **Output:**
```
PING 192.168.1.10 (192.168.1.10): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=0 ttl=64 time=0.055 ms
64 bytes from 192.168.1.10: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.060 ms
```

### **2. `telnet`**
#### **Why use it?**
`telnet` is used to check if a specific port on the destination VM is open and reachable. This helps to verify if a service running on the destination VM (like HTTP, SSH, etc.) is accessible.

#### **Example:**
```bash
telnet <destination-ip-or-hostname> <port>
```
#### **Details provided:**
- **Success:** A successful connection indicates that the port is open and the service is running.
- **Failure:** A failed connection could mean the service is down, the port is closed, or there is a firewall/network issue.

#### **Output:**
```
Trying 192.168.1.10...
Connected to 192.168.1.10.
Escape character is '^]'.
```
or
```
Trying 192.168.1.10...
telnet: Unable to connect to remote host: Connection refused
```

### **3. `nslookup`**
#### **Why use it?**
`nslookup` is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. It helps ensure DNS is correctly configured and functional.

#### **Example:**
```bash
nslookup <hostname>
```
#### **Details provided:**
- **IP address:** Resolves the domain name to its corresponding IP address.
- **DNS server:** The DNS server used for the query.

#### **Output:**
```
Server:  8.8.8.8
Address: 8.8.8.8#53

Name: example.com
Address: 93.184.216.34
```

### **4. `traceroute` (or `tracert` on Windows)**
#### **Why use it?**
`traceroute` identifies the path packets take to reach the destination VM. This is useful for diagnosing routing issues.

#### **Example:**
```bash
traceroute <destination-ip-or-hostname>
```
#### **Details provided:**
- **Hops:** Each router the packet passes through on its way to the destination.
- **Latency:** Time taken to reach each hop.

#### **Output:**
```
1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  1.365 ms  1.271 ms  1.234 ms
2  10.0.0.1 (10.0.0.1)  20.442 ms  20.592 ms  20.644 ms
3  93.184.216.34 (93.184.216.34)  35.104 ms  35.047 ms  35.023 ms
```

### **5. `curl`**
#### **Why use it?**
`curl` is used to check the availability and response of HTTP/HTTPS endpoints on the destination VM. It’s useful for web services.

#### **Example:**
```bash
curl http://<destination-ip-or-hostname>:<port>
```
#### **Details provided:**
- **HTTP response code:** Indicates if the service is reachable (e.g., `200 OK`).
- **Response content:** Displays any returned content from the server (e.g., HTML, JSON).

#### **Output:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

---

### **6. `netcat` (or `nc`)**
#### **Why use it?**
`netcat` is a versatile tool to check port connectivity and test data transmission.

#### **Example:**
```bash
nc -zv <destination-ip-or-hostname> <port>
```
#### **Details provided:**
- **Success:** If the port is open and reachable.
- **Failure:** If the port is closed or inaccessible.

#### **Output:**
```
Connection to 192.168.1.10 80 port [tcp/http] succeeded!
```
